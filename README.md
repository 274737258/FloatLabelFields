`FloatLabelFields` is the Swift implementation of a UX pattern that has come to be known as the **"Float Label Pattern"**. The initial Objective-C implementation of this pattern can be found on Github as [JVFloatLabeledTextField](https://github.com/jverdi/JVFloatLabeledTextField).

Due to space constraints on mobile devices, it is common to rely solely on placeholders as a means to label fields.
This presents a UX problem, in that, once the user begins to fill out a form, no labels are present.

This UI component library, which includes both a `UITextField` and `UITextView` subclass, aims to improve the user experience by having placeholders transition into floating labels that hover above the fields after they are populated with text.

Credits for the concept to Matt D. Smith ([@mds](http://www.twitter.com/mds)), and his [original design](http://dribbble.com/shots/1254439--GIF-Mobile-Form-Interaction?list=users):

`FloatLabelFields` currently includes just the `UITextField` implementation, though I plan to add supprt for `UITextView` in the near future. Since the code is Swift-based, do note that the component will only work on iOS 7.x+.
